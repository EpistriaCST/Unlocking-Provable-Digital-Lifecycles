# Public Release Announcement

### CSTP / EIV / Relational Merkle Repository Now Open

Today I am releasing a complete cryptographic framework—five documents, a unified model—that solves a simple but unresolved problem:

**How do you prove that something existed, and changed—or was destroyed—without continuing to hold the thing itself?**

**Example:** A financial institution needs to prove an account was deleted to satisfy GDPR, while simultaneously proving it once existed to satisfy SEC record-retention rules. This system makes both possible, cryptographically.

This repository publishes the answer in full. No paywalls. No gated licensing. No "contact us for enterprise access." It is free for anyone to use, critique, extend, ignore, or improve.

## What's Being Released

A full-stack system for provable state transitions and verifiable absence:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **1. Audit-Verifiable EIVs** | Ephemeral Initialization Vectors—prove something existed after it's gone. |
| **2. Transition-State Model** | Turns lifecycle events (create, migrate, destroy) into cryptographic objects. |
| **3. CSTP Core** | Cryptographic State Transition Proofs—irreversible, verifiable state evolution. |
| **4. Graph Lifecycle** | Applies CSTP to interdependent assets—branching, merging, cascading deletion. |
| **5. Relational Merkle Closures** | Cryptographic proof that no valid dependency path exists (A ⇏ B). |

These documents are not marketing brochures. They are the working blueprints—mechanisms, proofs, data structures, lifecycle logic, receipts, Merkle chaining, failure modes, and maths.

## Why This Exists

Every regulatory environment, cloud system, forensic investigation, database, supply chain, and audit process quietly suffers from the same contradiction:

> *"Erase this data."*  
> *"Prove you had it."*  
> *"But also prove you don't have it anymore"*

Existing systems either lie, log it, or litigate it.  
This one proves it—without appeals to trust, authority, or secrecy.

## Is It Practical?

Yes.

- **Verification takes microseconds.**
- **Storage scales logarithmically**, not linearly with history or dataset size.
- No blockchain bloat. No trusted third party. No proprietary SDK required.

## What This Is Not

This repository does **not** solve governance.  
It does not enforce ethics, law, or "responsible use."  
It does not prevent people from doing the wrong thing with the right tools.

It is deliberately limited to the part cryptography can actually do:

✔ Make destruction provable.  
✔ Make tampering obvious.  
✔ Make absence verifiable.  
✔ Make trust optional.

Governance, politics, and morality are left to others.

## How It's Licensed

- MIT License. Fork it, break it, build on it. Attribution required, nothing more.

## Who This Is For

This release is for:

- Engineers who want verifiable deletion instead of log entries.
- Cryptographers who recognize that integrity includes *absence*.
- Auditors and regulators tired of "proprietary compliance dashboards".
- People who don't need permission to build.

## What Happens Next

Maybe nothing. Or maybe a new standard.

I won't run a foundation.  
I won't build a certification board.  
I won't form a steering committee.  
This is now public infrastructure. If someone wants to take it further, they will. If I can get a fence post out of it, that's something very much appreciated.

## Repository Access

The full repository—including documents, raw specifications, LaTeX diagrams, maths, and reference implementations—will be available at:
